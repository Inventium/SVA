#Given an input of packages-on-servers-I-care-about, provide minfixes for vulnerabilities.
# 
# advice request:
I am about to code a basic vulnerability scanner which supplies minfixes.  
Is there, instead, something more useful/valuable I could be coding?

My focus is entirely on building skillset and reputation.  both of which are starting from git 0.

Thanks for all,
Happy Holidays,
